            <p>Nathu la is a high altitude pass situated on the old silk route at the Indo-China border, and is the favourite hotspot
                 for the tourists in Sikkim. Several visitors come here every year to enjoy the scenic trek to the valley while listening 
                 to the lyrical waterfalls astriding the road from Gangtok to Nathu la. It also offers the breathtaking view of the snow
                  covered mountains under the light blue sky and the long winding roads. Nathu la offers the mesmerizing view of Chumbi
                   valley of Tibet, guarded by mountains.

                  blessed with picturesque beauty and fresh mountain breeze. The place mainly receives cold 
                  weather for most of the parts of the year and gets flocked with visitors during summers.
                   One another fascinating fact about this mountainous pass is that it is one of the three
                    trading border posts between China and India, the other two are in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.</p><hr>
            <h1>Best time to visit</h1>
            <p>Summer, between the months of May to October is the appropriate season to visit here.

                    Otherwise, this is not the season considered as best time to visit Nathula Pass, because of the snow-blocked 
                    roads and extremely cold temperature. Though the amazing view of snow-showered mountains and frozen lakes can 
                    blow your mind with its beauty and charm. The same is the case during rains more or less.</p><hr>
