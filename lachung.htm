            <h2>About the lachung</h2><hr><hr>
            <p>Lachung is a town and hill station in northeast Sikkim, India. It is located in the North Sikkim district near the border with Tibet.
            Lachung is at an elevation of about 9,600 feet (2,900 m) and at the confluence of the Lachen and Lachung Rivers, both tributaries of
            the River Teesta. The word Lachung means "small pass". The town is approximately 125 kilometres (78 mi) from the capital Gangtok.
            The Indian Army has a forward base in the town. Before the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1950, Lachung [2] was a trading post between 
            Sikkim and Tibet, after which it was closed down. The town's economy has been boosted by tourism in recent years as the region has 
            been opened up by the Indian government.</p>

        <h2>Lachung In Winter (October To February)</h2>
           
            If you are an adventurous soul, the winter is the most appropriate time for you to visit Lachung. Enjoy the snowfall, the chilly winter
            breeze and amazing views of the mountains covered in snow. During winter, the temperature ranges from 10°C to -5°C and the entire
            region looks milky white. This is the season when you can enjoy outdoor activities without feeling hot or dehydrated by the sun.
            
           <h2>Lachung In Summer (March To May)</h2>
            The temperature of Lachen during the summer ranges between 10°C and 28°C and it is quite moderate. During the day you might feel hot 
            but in the morning and evening, it is quite pleasant. You can easily roam around and visit all the attractions of Lachung.
            Since summers are not too hot in Lachung, tourists come in great numbers from far and wide. This season is also the time
            when this destination gets peppered with rhododendron flowers making it look all the more charming.
            
            <h2>Lachung In Monsoon (July To September)</h2>
            Monsoon is marked with heavy rainfall in Lachung. No doubt monsoon has its own beauty in Lachung but it can make holidays of 
            travellers quite troublesome. You can’t enjoy outdoor activities and sightseeing. So it is better you avoid this season and 
            plan your trip to Lachung in winter or summer.</p>
