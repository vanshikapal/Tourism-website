            <p>The popular Yumthang Valley in North Sikkim is located 140 km north of Gangtok. Famous as the "Valley of flowers",
                 this is a rare and exotic location with hot springs, rivers, yaks and lush green meadows.
                  Situated at an elevation on 3564 metres, this stunning valley is a paradise for nature 
                  lovers as it houses the Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary which has over 24 species of 
                  Rhododendron flowers (the state flower) blooming from late February to mid-June.
                <br>
                Yumthang Valley is closed to tourists between December and March due to the heavy snowfall in the region. 
                A few hot springs are situated in Yumthang Valley, which is often visited by tourists as they are believed
                 to have miraculous healing power. Apart from a cosmic green meadow, plush green forest abundant in Pine
                  and silver fir trees fills the area. On your way towards Yumthang Valley, you can see gushing waterfalls
                   and streams along with a splendid view of peaks with Pauhunri and Shundu Tsenpa.</p>

        <h1>Best time to visit</h1>
            <p>The best time to visit Yumthang Valley is February to mid-June, as the weather remains the best during this time.
               Kindly note that the Yumthang valley is quite close to the Indo-Chinese border, you may need a permit to 
               reach the place. You can ask your agent to arrange for the permit before leaving for the place.</p><hr>

    <h1>How to Reach</h1>
    <p>The best way to reach Yumthang is to travel to Lachung from Gangtok, which is about 125 kms, by a shared or personal vehicle and 
    stay overnight. It is not feasible to travel to Yumthang directly from Gangtok in a day as the region is prone to fogs and 
    becomes dark very early. From Lachung, the drive to Yumthang take just around 50 minutes and the road is lined with colourful
     blooming flowers, making for a soothing and spectacular ride</p>.<br><hr>
     
    <h1>Tips for Visiting Yumthang Valley</h1>
    <p>Make sure you plan your trip during the best time to visit Yumthang so that you have the most impeccable experience possible.
     Since the valley is situated close to the China border, the whole area is under the control of the army, and a Protected Area Permit is required for visiting it as a tourist. So, don’t forget to get it from the Gangtok Tourism Office, District Administrative Center at Mangan or at Chungthang Sub-Divisional Magistrate’s Office while planning your tour. Or you can also ask your tour planner to arrange it for you.
     Irrespective of the season in which you are visiting Yumthang, make sure you carry warm clothes as the weather can get really cold up there.
     Don’t forget to carry your essential toiletries and medicines, especially the one for high altitude sickness.
     Carry enough cash with you as there are no ATMs in Yumthang.
     Prefer staying for a night at Lachung and begin your journey to Yumthang only early in the morning, as the evening gets darker and foggier quite early around 5:30 PM there.
     Make sure your shoes are sturdy enough.
     If you’re not too comfortable with the food in the hills, you can carry your own munchies or find a decent restaurant in Sikkim.</p><hr>
